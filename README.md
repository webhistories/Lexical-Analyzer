The ROTCompiler is an abbreviation for Reserved Organized Tactical Compiler. The compiler name was inspired by the civic training program, the Reserve Officer Training Corps, for the purpose of preparing college or university students physically and mentally if ever put into battle. The structure of the language is somewhat similar to the specific programming languages, namely C/C++/Python, but with variations on terms and other formats. The reserved words that are used in this compiler are based on the commands that are practiced on the field. This concept was proposed by a group of Computer Science students from the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. Also, they are responsible for the design and the development of the compiler.
